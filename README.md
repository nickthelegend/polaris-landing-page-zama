## 🌍 About Polaris
Polaris enables decentralized credit by utilizing Chainlink CCIP to pass messages between Satellite Chains (where collateral is locked) and the Master Chain (where credit and debt are managed).

For the actual decentralized application and user dashboard, please see the [`polaris-network`](../polaris-network) project within this workspace.
